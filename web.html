                Tourism New Zealand is an organisation who market New Zealand to the world as a tourist destination.
                They use the 100% Pure Green New Zealand as their main marketing campaign. Tourism New Zealand is
                responsible for ensuring that New Zealand remains attractive internationally as a visitor destination.
                The task is to create a single page accomdation quoting application, based on how many nights, how many
                people. The second part of the task is to display meal options for the chosen accomodation given.<br>
                The application is intended to be used by tourists who are looking at coming over to New Zealand for
                travel. The target audience for this brief is very broad and there is no specific age group or gender
                that the app is being marketed towards. The asthetic of the app should have a subtle clean and green
                feel to it.
